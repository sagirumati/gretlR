gretlR Package: Integration of R and gretl
================
Sagiru Mati (PhD)

# About gretlR

gretlR is an R package that can run `gretl` program from R Markdown.

# Installation

gretlR can be installed using the following commands in R.

``` r
install.packages("gretlR")

          OR
          
devtools::install_github('sagirumati/gretlR')
```

# Usage

Please load the gretlR package as follows:

    ```{r gretlR}                                                             
    library(gretlR)
    ```

Then create a chunk for `gretl` as shown below:

```` 
```{gretl gretlR1,eval=T,echo=T,comment=NULL} 
nulldata 500
set seed 13
gretl1 = normal()
gretl2 = normal()
setobs 12 1980:01 --time-series
gnuplot gretl1 --time-series --with-lines --output="line.png"
gnuplot gretl2 gretl1 --output="scatter.png"
ols gretl1 const gretl2
modeltab add
tabprint --output="ols.Rmd"
eqnprint --output="olsmodel.Rmd"
tabprint --output="ols.csv"
```  
````

The above chunk creates an gretl program with the chunkâ€™s content, then
automatically gretl, which will save gretl outputs in the current
directory.

We can *dynamically and reproducibly* fetch the `gretl` graph object we
created with the `gretl` chunk using the following R chunk:

For the scatter graph:

``` r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("inst/examples/scatter.png")
```

<div class="figure">

<img src="inst/examples/scatter.png" alt="Scatter graph produced by gretl chunk" width="\textwidth" />

<p class="caption">

Scatter graph produced by gretl chunk

</p>

</div>

<br><br><br><br>

or the line graph:

``` r
knitr::include_graphics("inst/examples/line.png")
```

<div class="figure">

<img src="inst/examples/line.png" alt="Line graph produced by gretl chunk" width="\textwidth" />

<p class="caption">

Line graph produced by gretl chunk

</p>

</div>

we can also include the equation of the OLS generated by the `gretl`
chunk using the following R chunk;

<br><br><br><br>

Remember the OLS equation output is saved by the `gretl` chunk as
`olsmodel.Rmd`. The entire OLS equation model:

    ```{r child, child='olsmodel.Rmd'} 
    
    ```

%%% the following needs the amsmath LaTeX package

<br><br><br><br>

Remember the OLS table output is saved by `gretl` chunk as `ols.Rmd`.
The entire OLS table output:

    ```{r child1, child="ols.Rmd"} 
    
    ```

<br><br><br><br>

Unfortunately, user of `gretl` has little or no control over the outputs
customisation before exporting.
